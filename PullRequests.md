* [RxJava - Implemented the `combineLatest` operator](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/pull/207)
  
  This pull request implemented the Rx `combineLatest` operator. 

  Before, it was non-functional code copied from some other operator. 
  I also documented the api and wrote tests to ensure correct behaviour, of course.

  Concurrency-wise, this operator implementation was quite hairy.
